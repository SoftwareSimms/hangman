## Project Description
The Hangman Game is a Python-based implementation of the classic word guessing game. In this project, players guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. 

The of this project was to demonstrate fundamental Python programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, loops, and conditionals.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the Hangman game, you will need a Python environment. Here's how to get started:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.

## Usage Instructions
To play the Hangman game, follow these instructions:

1. In the terminal or command prompt, run the script with Python:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py

## Dev Lessons
Using a class to initalise variables that adapt to whichever word is randomly selected from the word list inspired my imagination visualising how it is applied to high level gaming by utilising this style of object orientated logic.
